# Business decisions

**Status: CURRENT**

This is the canonical log of explicit product/business decisions — rules chosen by the product owner that shape FloCafe's behavior and aren't derivable from reading the code alone. It exists so that anyone (human or AI agent) making a change can check whether their approach would silently contradict a decision that was already made deliberately, rather than rediscovering or re-litigating it.

**Before implementing a change that touches authorization, access control, defaults, or another area covered below, read this file.** If a task seems to require deviating from a decision here, stop and confirm with the user explicitly — do not assume the decision is stale or was a mistake just because it's inconvenient for the task at hand. If a decision genuinely no longer fits (the product has grown, a new constraint appeared), update this file in the same change that changes the behavior, with a note on what changed and why — never let code and this document drift apart silently.

This document is a peer of the `AGENTS.md` core invariants, not a replacement: invariants there are the small set of load-bearing rules every change must respect; this file is the fuller, growing log of specific decisions, including narrower ones that wouldn't belong in that short list.

## How entries are structured

Each decision states: the rule, why it exists, where it's enforced in code, how to verify the codebase still complies, and when it was decided. "How to verify" should be something an agent can actually run (a grep, a test suite) — a decision without a verifiable check is easy to violate by accident.

## Orders are never ownership-gated

**Rule:** Any staff role with order access (owner, manager, cashier, server — see `docs/roles-and-permissions.md`) can view and act on **every** order, regardless of who created it. There is no "this is my order" restriction anywhere in the system.

**Why:** FloCafe is an open system by design. Restricting staff to only the orders they personally created adds friction (a waiter covering a colleague's table, a manager checking in on any order) without a real security benefit for this product — accountability comes from knowing who did what, not from hiding data between staff who already share a till and a kitchen.

**What restriction remains instead:**
1. **Role-based page/feature access** — e.g. chef cannot open the Orders page at all; cashier cannot access owner/manager-only settings.
2. **Role-based restriction on a specific action** — e.g. KDS stage transitions (marking an item "preparing"/"ready"/"served") are chef/manager/owner-only (`ROLE_ACCESS.kitchen`), further narrowed by the chef's assigned kitchen station and category (see `main/routes/order-items.ts`). A server can place an order but cannot do the kitchen's job on it.
3. **Audit attribution** — every order and write is still recorded against the authenticated actor (`user_id`, `created_by`, etc.). This is for the audit trail (who did what), not for gating access.

**Enforced by (i.e., where this would be violated if reintroduced):** `main/routes/orders.ts` (order list, `GET /:id`, `POST /:id/items`, `PATCH /:id/status`), `main/routes/index.ts` (item cancel/void), `main/routes/printers.ts` (`print-kot`). None of these compare `order.user_id` (or an item's creator) against the requesting user to decide access.

**How to verify:** `grep -rn "role === 'server'" main/routes/ | grep -i "user_id"` (or similarly, `grep -rn "user_id !== " main/`) should return **nothing**. If it returns a match, that's a reintroduction of this pattern and should be treated as a bug, not a feature — confirm with the user before keeping it.

**Decided:** 2026-09-12. Reverses a restriction that existed in the codebase and was at one point documented as fixing "vuln-0007: IDOR on Order List Endpoints" (see `tests/security-hardening.test.ts` history) — that framing was the prior, now-corrected understanding; this entry is the current one.

## Refunds on already-completed orders

**Rule:** Owners (and, within the first hour of an order, managers too) can refund a bill that has already been paid — in full, partially, or for a single item — without restocking inventory. The refund can be paid back in a different method than the customer originally used, or issued as store credit. Specifically:

1. **Ceiling:** a refund can never exceed `paid_amount − sum(prior refunds)` for that bill (not the order's gross total), so a bill already partially refunded can't be refunded again past what's actually left outstanding. Enforced by `getRefundableBalance()` in `main/services/refund.ts`.
2. **Approval tiers, keyed off the order's `created_at`:**
   - Within 1 hour of order creation: owner **or** manager PIN, as before this feature (in-progress orders, unchanged).
   - After 1 hour but still the same business day (per the tenant's configured timezone and `business_day_start_time`, via `dayBoundsInTimezone()`): **owner PIN only** — a manager PIN is rejected outright. There is no kitchen/service context left to sanity-check a request once the order is effectively closed, so the bar is raised rather than reused.
   - Once the order's business day has ended: refused entirely (409), regardless of who approves. A merchant needing to reverse an older transaction does so outside the system (e.g. a manual adjustment), not through this endpoint.
3. **Item eligibility** for a single-item refund now includes `served` and `completed`, not just `preparing`/`ready` — a served/completed item is exactly what "already-completed order" refunds are for.
4. **Refund payment method is independent of the original payment method(s)** — a card payment can be refunded in cash, or vice versa. This is deliberate (per the product decision behind this feature), not a validation gap.
5. **Store credit** (`method: 'wallet'`) requires loyalty to be enabled and the bill to have a customer attached. It's recorded as a plain `credit` row in `loyalty_ledger` (the same mechanism cashback uses), so it's immediately spendable — no separate "refund credit" ledger type exists. This does **not** double-count as cashback on respend: `calculateCashback()` in `main/routes/bills.ts` already excludes wallet-funded spend from the cashback base.
6. **Accepted limitation:** refunding an item/order does **not** claw back cashback that was already credited on that sale at payment time. Given FloCafe's current install-base scale (see `AGENTS.md` "Lessons from past mistakes"), building proportional cashback clawback was judged not worth the complexity for a v1. Revisit if this is observed to be abused.
7. **No per-role permission grant exists yet.** Refund initiation is gated the same way it already was (`ROLE_ACCESS.ownerManager` at the route), not by a configurable owner-editable grant — `docs/roles-and-permissions.md` already documents that role configuration/IAM isn't available. Letting an owner grant refund access to other roles (e.g. cashier) is deferred to that future IAM work, not built here.
8. Inventory is never restored by a refund (item-level or whole-bill) — consistent with how item voids/cancellations already behave.

**Why:** Requested as a controlled way to reverse completed sales without reopening the order-editing surface, while keeping the two things most exposed to misuse — how far back a refund can reach, and who can approve one — deliberately tight (same-business-day cutoff, owner-only once the in-progress window has passed).

**Enforced by:** `main/services/refund.ts` (`createRefund`, `resolveRefundApprover`, `REFUND_ITEM_ELIGIBLE_STATUSES`), `main/routes/refunds.ts`. Audit trail: every refund now also writes a `refund_issued` row to `order_audit_log` (previously refunds were only recorded in the `refunds` table).

**How to verify:** `npm run test:refunds` (original in-progress-refund behavior, budget-sensitive — see that file's header) and `npm run test:refund-completed-orders` (business-day tiers, expanded item eligibility, store credit, and the audit-log entry).

**Decided:** 2026-09-13.
